# MVC & Combined Patterns 

The MVC framework is made up of three patterns and three parts: 
* Model - Observer
* View - Composite
* Controller - Strategy

this works great in GUIs like swing where the view can have a strategy and all the Swing elements are really composites.  


For the web this is adapted somewhat because the controller needs to be an intermediary between the View and the Model.
