# Template Method

**Definition**: 
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation. deferring some steps to subclasses.  Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm:s structure.  

The base class usually provides a 'hook' to the subclasses which allows them to implement their step in the algorithm.
