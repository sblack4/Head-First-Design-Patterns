# Design Principles 

## First 5: S.O.L.I.D. (from Uncle Bob)

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle
HFDP p. 348  
*A class should only have one reason to change*. 

## 2. Open-Closed Principle 
HFDP p. 88  
*Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification*

## 3. Liskov-Substitution Principle 
Subclasses should be substitutable for base classes

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle 
Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they donâ€™t use

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle 
HFDP p. 141  
*Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes* 

## More misc OO Principles: 

## Encapsulate what Varies
Fewer unintended consequences, less changing existing code, and more flexibility! 

## Favor Composition over Inheritance 
Allows you to encapsulate algorithms and even change behavior at runtime 

## Program to interfaces, not implementations 
Could equally be '*Program to a supertype*'.  This allows us to exploit polymorphism to lend flexibility.  

## Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact 
This allows for flexible OO systems that can handle change by minimizing interdependency between objects.  

## Principle of Least Knowledge / Law of Demeter
HFDP p. 273  
*Only talk to your friends* and therefore reduce coupling

## Hollywood Principle
HFDP p. 304  
The '*Don't call us, we'll call you*' principle.
