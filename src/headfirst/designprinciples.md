## Design Principles 

# Encapsulate what Varies
Fewer unintended consequences, less changing existing code, and more flexibility! 

# Favor Composition over Inheritance 
Allows you to encapsulate algorithms and even change behavior at runtime 

# Program to interfaces, not implementations 
Could equally be '*Program to a supertype*'.  This allows us to exploit polymorphism to lend flexibility.  

# Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact 
This allows for flexible OO systems that can handle change by minimizing interdependency between objects.  

# Open-Closed Principle 
*Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification*

# Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes

# Only talk to your friends

# Hollywood Principle
The '*Don't call us, we'll call you*' principle.  

# Single Responsibility Principle
*A class should only have one reason to change*.
